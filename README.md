# My Dotfiles

Yet another attempt at managing my dotfiles between an environment. I've used various more complex tools but I 
really just wanted something that was dead simple. For now I'm going to be giving GNU `stow` a shot and see
how it works out. 

Most of this is made to be used on a clean Arch install and most of the configs here revolve around `hyprland` with `rofi`, `sddm`, `waybar`, and so on.
The original configs came from an install of [JaKooLit](https://github.com/JaKooLit)'s [Arch-Hyprland](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland) scripts
that I have begun moving out and modifying for my needs.
